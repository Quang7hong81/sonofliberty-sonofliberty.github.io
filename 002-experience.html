                        Working for the German web development agency <a href="https://www.life-style.de">LifeStyle</a>
                        helped me grow to a professional web developer. I got rid of bad habits that come along with
                        learning to code on your own and learned a lot during my time there.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I built e-commerce and content management solutions for clients, including a large global
                        leadership and language training company and a German travel agency as part of an awesome agile
                        development team lead by great project managers and senior developers.

                    <p>
                        Ultimately I left LifeStyle to focus on growing and maintaining BitcoinVN's web applications
                        and its corresponding IT infrastructure, which I have been doing in my free time.

                        I shared my passion for Bitcoin with a friend of mine living in Vietnam. This resulted in the
                        creation of <a href="https://bitcoinvn.io/en" target="_blank">Bitcoin Vietnam</a> (now "BitcoinVN"),
                        the first Bitcoin exchange on the Vietnamese market. I am one of four co founders of the company.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The exchange has quite a remarkable international reputation. I added support for several other
                        digital assets over the years. Currently you can buy and sell Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Ethereum,
                        Litecoin and Dash on the site.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        So far, BitcoinVN helped thousands of users securely and reliably exchange millions of Dollars
                        worth of cryptocurrency.

                        During my free time as a law student I started playing around with web development. My
                        fascination of Bitcoin sparked the urge to start building software.
                    </p>
                    <p> I started with silly things like changing the color of my Philips Hue light bulbs on each Bitcoin
                        transaction and later picking up freelance programming which lead to the creation of
                        <a href="https://www.bitfortip.com" target="_blank">Bitfortip</a>, a site that rewards you with
                        Bitcoin for answering other user's questions.
