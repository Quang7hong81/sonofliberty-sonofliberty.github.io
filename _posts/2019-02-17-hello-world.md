Welcome to my personal site. 
This is the first static page I created with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).
I figured you can also easily host Jekyll sites via [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/), 
which is helpful as you don't have to worry about setting up a web server.

I customized the "Sandstone" theme from [Bootswatch](https://github.com/thomaspark/bootswatch) to make the navigation bar
look like a PHP class structure. Call it silly, but I think it's pretty clever.

Of course, you are free to use and customize this theme any way you want.
